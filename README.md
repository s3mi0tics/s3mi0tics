Welcome to my GitHub!

    My name is Colby Kauk, and I believe the value lies in the relationship.


My journey as a developer began in the fall of 2022 when I joined the Coding Dojo Bootcamp. I’m committed to doing *whatever it takes* to continue growing until I can make a meaningful impact on others' lives through my craft as a coder.

I'm a driven *full-stack web developer* and a recent graduate of Harvard's CS50, with proficiency in **Python, Java, and React/Node.js.** I’ve also been trained in **MySQL** and **MongoDB**.

# Here to build.

## Current Projects

I'm a dedicated parent raising two boys. I strive to foster kindness and connection while emphasizing resilience, grit, and determination. My family is my top priority and serves as a constant source of motivation and inspiration.

Currently building *Nexus* with a small team — a Web3 gaming platform that leverages crypto assets to power real-time, on-chain gameplay. Nexus integrates NFT staking, secure wallet connectivity, and responsive, component-based UI architecture to deliver immersive blockchain-native gaming experiences. Launch coming soon.

Technology consultant for *MEC Builds* (roofing industry), designing and implementing digital solutions to streamline safety workflows and ensure regulatory compliance.
